# Template
## Name of Product
## Author/Company Name

## Introduction
A summary of what the product is all about. Here, you may want to talk about the problem you’re trying to solve

## Vision
Formats:
For "target customer segments" who must "problem to be solved", our product is a new "category name" that provides "solution to the problem". Unlike "current solutions", we offer "key differentiating factor".
We help "X" to "Y" by "Z".
Note that these help to state your target market, the problem you want to solve, the solution to the problem, and your competitors.

## Goal
The goal of this product is to achieve "insert metrics" by "a specific time"

## Who Is It For?
Your target audience

## Strategy
This basically talks about how you plan to build the product - the step-by-step process, unit economics, features, etc.

### What Is It?
This contains many branches, which include:
### User Types
Includes the different types of users (if there’s more than one type) that will be using your product. This section can also contain user personas. It can also contain the functions accessible to the admin/super admin of the product.
### Features of the Product
Contains all the necessary features of the product and their description. This also helps in prioritization.
### Epics and User Stories
An epic can be seen as a collection of user stories. A user story can be written as: “As a "persona", I want to "do this", "so that".” You can attach a link if this has been created in another document.
### Wireframes:
While being a designer skill, it is helpful to have this skill as a PM as it helps you communicate clearly with designers. Wireframing tools include Whimsical and Balsamiq.
Future Features:
Features you want in the product but may not be launched with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Roadmap:
There are a lot of tools used in building roadmaps eg ProductPlan, Jira, Trello, ClickUp etc.

## Go-to-market plan/strategy
What plans are you making to launch your product into the market? Have you studied the market, the times, and trends? What innovative method do you plan to use? For example, check out how the iPod was launched with these simple words “1,000 songs in your pocket”. What catchy words are you using to get your customers’ attention?

## Costs
Engineering costs: how many engineers and weeks will the project require? How much would storage cost? All these details can be gotten from your engineering team?
Market costs: how much it would cost in launching and marketing your product

## Risks
This should be presented in a tabular format and should contain possible risks of the product and its descriptions. The strengths of these risks can also be put in detail. See below an example of a risk assertion table
